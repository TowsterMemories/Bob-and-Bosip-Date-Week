# TowsterFlxUtil

This is my little package that I like to use for debugging and such

If has things that **I** want but I though that some people might find this useful

It has:

    Sprite System:
        animatable with a sprite-sheet
        offsetting

    A little Paths file for `lime create tpl -n ""` templates
